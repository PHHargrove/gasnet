  This is the "memory_kinds" feature branch of GASNet-EX, intended only
  for use by developers with a specific interest in this feature.
  Other client developers should consider use of the "stable" branch.
  GASNet conduit developers not working specifically on memory kinds
  should be targeting the "develop" branch for any pull requests.

  While it is intended that features and capabilities introduced in this
  branch will make their way into a full release of GASNet-EX, this is
  only a prototype. All aspects of the APIs and capabilities first
  introduced on this branch are subject to non-trivial changes before
  the prototype stage ends.

# Introduction

This document provides a detailed status of the Memory Kinds feature
implementation and is updated as that status changes.

This document will make references to two other documents, which are
available on request from gasnet-staff@lbl.gov:  

  + GASNet-EX API Proposal: Multi-EP
  + GASNet-EX API Proposal: Memory Kinds

For brevity, these will be referenced as "the Multi-EP Proposal" and
"the Memory Kinds Proposal", respectively.

# General Usage

By default, the `configure` script in this branch probes for the necessary CUDA
headers and libraries and enable the prototype implementation of memory kinds if
such support is found.  Use of configure new option `--enable-mem-kind-cuda-uva`
will make failure of that probe fatal.

On our main development platforms, the logic in `configure` is sufficient to
locate the required headers and libraries with no additional options.  However,
the following options (and environment equivalents) are available to guide the
probe if needed:  

  + `--with-cuda-home=...` or `CUDA_HOME`
  + `--with-cuda-cflags=...` or `CUDA_CFLAGS`
  + `--with-cuda-libs=...` or `CUDA_LIBS`
  + `--with-cuda-ldflags=...` or `CUDA_LDFLAGS`

Generally, it is sufficient to provide the installation prefix of the CUDA
toolkit using either `--with-cuda-home=...` or `CUDA_HOME`, since the others
all have sensible defaults once the installation prefix is known.

# Supported Configurations

All current memory kinds implementation work is limited to devices with the
CUDA Device API and Unified Virtual Memory (UVA).

Support is limited to ibv-conduit on Linux and only when using Mellanox
InfiniBand hardware and drivers with support for "GPUDirect RDMA".  In some
cases additional optional software, such as "nvidia_peer_memory" must be
installed.  Please consult Mellanox documentation for assistance determining
what driver software is needed for your specific hardware and Linux
distribution.  The Open MPI and MVAPICH projects also have some documentation
regarding deployment of GPUDirect RDMA for their respective MPI implementations.

Furthermore, only `GASNET_SEGMENT_FAST` segment mode is supported.  This is the
default segment mode, but can be specified explicitly at configure time using
the `--enable-segment-fast` option.  To be clear: `--enable-segment-large` and
`--enable-segment-everything` configurations of ibv-conduit do not support
the memory kinds work in this branch.

To the best of our knowledge, Mellanox currently disclaims support for GPUDirect
RDMA on aarch64 (aka ARM64 or ARMv8) and NVIDIA does not support UVA on ILP32
platforms.  Therefore, this work currently supports only x86-64 and ppc64le.

## Multi-rail

Though our test and development systems have multi-rail InfiniBand networks,
there are currently unresolved issues with respect to use of multiple rails
within a given process.  Consequentially, support is currently limited to
single-rail configurations, which can be achieved ether at configure time by
using the option `--disable-ibv-multirail`, or at runtime by setting the
environment variable `GASNET_IBV_PORTS` to name a single valid port.  Both
mechanisms are documented in `ibv-conduit/README`.

## CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS)

Testing conducted to date is insufficient to establish whether the current
implementation is compatible with the use of CUDA MPS.  Reports (positive or
negative) regarding such compatibility are welcome.

## Loopback and PSHM

Currently the implementation is sufficient (when using supported hardware,
drivers and libraries) to perform RMA operations between combinations of host
and GPU memory in which the two involved endpoints are in distinct "nbrhds".
This precludes any RMA transfers between endpoints in the same process, or
intra-nbrhd transfers when PSHM is active (where "inactive" equates to either
`--disable-pshm` at configure time, or `GASNET_SUPERNODE_MAXSIZE=1` in ones
environment at runtime).  This is a temporary limitation.

Notably, the transfers prohibited by the current limitation are ones that can be
performed using `cudaMemcpy()`, or `cuMemcpy{DtoH,HtoD,DtoD}()` (possibly with
some CUDA calls to enable peer-to-peer access).  Therefore, it is recommended
practice (and will *continue* to be so when this limitation is removed) that
clients bypass GASNet-EX to perform such transfers.

# Tested Configurations

We have yet to establish the minimum required versions of hardware, drivers or
libraries.  However, the following two platforms are our primary development
systems and represent "known good" combinations (modulo those caveats listed
elsewhere in this document, such as with regards to multi-rail):

Summit:  

  + ppc64le (IBM POWER9)
  + CUDA 10.1.243
  + Mellanox ConnectX-5 HCAs
  + NVIDIA Volta-class GPUs

Dirac:  

  + x86_64 (Intel Nahalem)
  + CUDA 11.0
  + Mellanox ConnectX-5 HCAs
  + NVIDIA Maxwell-class GPUs

Eventual minimum requirements may be lower than those of either platform, or
possibly higher.

# Implementation Status Summary

Currently the implementation is sufficient (when hardware, software and
configuration constraints are met) to use the pseudo-code below to perform RMA
operations between combinations of host and GPU memory (subject to the
previously noted temporary prohibition on loopback intra-nbrhd transfers).

Please note that all error checking has been elided from this example.

```
  // Bootstrap and establish host memory segment for the primordial endpoints
  gex_Client_Init(&myClient, &myEP, &myTM, "MK example", &argc, &argv, 0)
  gex_Segment_Attach(...);

  // Create memory kind object for CUDA device 0
  gex_MK_t dev0Kind;
  gex_MK_Create_args_t args;
  args.gex_flags = 0;
  args.gex_class = GEX_MK_CLASS_CUDA_UVA;
  args.gex_args.gex_class_cuda_uva.gex_CUdevice = 0;
  gex_MK_Create(&dev0_kind, myClient, args, 0);

  // Ask GASNet to allocate a 1GB CUDA UVA segment
  gex_Segment_t dev0Segment;
  gex_Segment_Create(&dev0Segment, myClient, NULL, 1024*1024*1024, dev0Kind, 0);

  // Create an RMA-only endpoint, bind dev0Segment and publish RMA credentials
  gex_EP_t dev0EP;
  gex_EP_Create(&dev0EP, myClient, GEX_EP_CAPABILITY_RMA, 0);
  gex_EP_BindSegment(dev0EP, dev0Segment, 0);
  gex_EP_PublishBoundSegment(myTM, &dev0EP, 1, 0);

  // Note assumptions made in remainder of this example
  assert( gex_EP_QueryIndex(myEP) == 0 );
  assert( gex_EP_QueryIndex(dev0EP) == 1 );

  // Query device addresses needed for RMA
  void *loc_dev0, *rem_dev0;
  loc_dev0 = gex_Segment_QueryAddr(dev0Segment);
  gex_Segment_QueryBound(gex_TM_Pair(myEP,1), peer_rank, &rem_dev0, NULL, NULL);
  
  // [ do something that places data in GPU memory ]

  // Perform a blocking 4MB GPU-to-GPU Get
  gex_RMA_GetBlocking(gex_TM_Pair(dev0EP,1), loc_dev0, peer_rank, rem_dev0, 4*1024*1024, 0);
```

# Implementation Status by GASNet-EX AP

This section describes the known limitations of each of the APIs introduced
recently in order to support memory kinds.  Due to interaction among
APIs, it is impossible to completely avoid forward references.

## Renames:

Some types, constants and functions have been renamed relative to the
original proposals:

  + `gex_Segment_EP_Bind()` is replaced by `gex_EP_SegmentBind()`
  + `gex_MemKind_Create()` is replaced by `gex_MK_Create()`
  + `gex_MemKind_Destroy()` is replaced by `gex_MK_Destroy()`
  + `gex_MemKind_t` is replaced by `gex_MK_t`
    - With the constant `GEX_MEMKIND_HOST` replaced by `GEX_MK_HOST`
  + `gex_MemKind_Class_t` becomes `gex_MK_Class_t`
    - With `GEX_MEMKIND_CLASS_` shortened `GEX_MK_CLASS_` in the naming of the
      enum values
  + `gex_MemKind_Create_args_t` to `gex_MK_Create_args_t`
    - With `gex_mk_` shortened to `gex_` in naming of struct and union members

The remainder of this section will utilize the new names exclusively.

## `gex_Segment_Attach()`

The `gex_Segment_Attach()` call remains the only supported means by which to
create and bind a segment to the primordial endpoint.  This is true despite the
recent introduction of APIs which, when used in the proper sequence, would
appear to provide a suitable replacement.

While this is technically a limitation of the alternative APIs, it is
documented here for clarity.

## `gex_Segment_Create()`

This API, along with all types and constants required to specify its arguments,
are defined and will link in any conduit.  However, it is useful only when
multi-EP support exists (see `gex_EP_Create()` for the current scope of
multi-EP support).

On ibv-conduit, specifically, the implementation of this API is believed to be
complete with respect to the Multi-EP Proposal.  In particular, it is capable
of creating segments of both client-allocated and GASNet-allocated memory,
using either the defined `kind` value `GEX_MK_HOST` or a kind created using
`gex_MK_Create()` with a class of `GEX_MK_CLASS_CUDA_UVA`.

Notably lacking from both specification and implementation is a means to request
or demand allocation of memory suitable for intra-nbrhd cross-mapping via PSHM.

## `gex_Segment_Destroy()`

Not currently implemented.

## `gex_EP_Create()`

This API, along with all types and constants required to specify its arguments,
are defined and will link in any conduit.  However, it is useful only when
multi-EP support exists, as descibed in the following paragraphs.

Any build of GASNet-EX from this branch will define a preprocessor macro
`GASNET_MAXEPS` which advertises the optimistic maximum number of endpoints per
process, inclusive of the primordial endpoint created by `gex_Client_Init()`.
Any call to `gex_EP_Create()` which would exceed this limit results in a fatal
error.  

Currently, only ibv-conduit in FAST segment mode has a value of `GASNET_MAXEPS`
larger than 1 (it is currently 8).  Additionally, ibv-conduit only supports the
`GEX_EP_CAPABILITY_RMA` capability for non-primordial endpoints.

The `GEX_FLAG_HINT_ACCEL_*` values are currently defined, but ignored.

## `gex_EP_BindSegment()`

This API, along with all types and constants required to specify its arguments,
are defined and will link in any conduit.  However, it is useful only when
multi-EP support exists (see `gex_EP_Create()` for the current scope of
multi-EP support).

## `gex_EP_PublishBoundSegment()`

This API did not appear in either the Multi-EP Proposal or Memory Kinds
Proposal.  Complete semantics are documented in `docs/GASNet-EX.txt`.

This call is currently necessary as the only means to actively distribute the
RMA credentials required by some conduits (ibv among them).  While this task is
performed in `gex_Segment_Attach()` for primordial endpoints, use of this API is
required prior to use of `gex_RMA_*()` APIs using non-primordial endpoints.  It
is hoped that this call can become optional in the future.

This API, along with all types and constants required to specify its arguments,
are defined and will link in any conduit.  However, it is useful only when
multi-EP support exists (see `gex_EP_Create()` for the current scope of
multi-EP support).

## `gex_TM_Pair()`

This API is believed to be fully implemented in all conduits and accepted by
all APIs required to by the Multi-EP Proposal (notably the `gex_RMA_*()`,
`gex_AM_*()` and `gex_VIS_*() API families).

Since multi-EP support is currently exclusive to ibv-conduit in FAST segment
mode, the use in other conduits is limited to aliasing of the primordial team.

## `gex_TM_Create()`

At this point in time, there is no support for non-primordial endpoints as
members of teams, and more specifically they are not accepted in the `args`
passed to `gex_TM_Create()`.  This means all RMA communication involving
non-primordial endpoints must currently utilize a `gex_TM_t` returned by
`gex_TM_pair()`.

## `gex_TM_Dup()`

Not implemented.

## `gex_TM_Destroy()`

Fully implemented.

## `gex_MK_Create()`

This API is (modulo the renames detiled earlier in this document), implemented
as described in the Memory Kinds Proposal.  This includes the conditional
definition (defined to `1` or undefined) of `GASNET_HAVE_MK_CLASS_CUDA_UVA`,
which is currently defined only when the necessary headers and libs were
located at configure time *and* one is using ibv-conduit in FAST segment mode.
In all other circumstances `GASNET_HAVE_MK_CLASS_CUDA_UVA` will be undefined.

While `GASNET_HAVE_MK_CLASS_CUDA_UVA` has only a conditional definition, the
enum value `GEX_MK_CLASS_CUDA_UVA` is defined unconditionally.  Any calls to
`gex_MK_Create()` specifying this class when *not* supported will return
`GASNET_ERR_BAD_ARG`, as documented in the Memory Kinds Proposal.

## `gex_MK_Destroy()`

This API is implemented, but is only legal for a kind not currently in use by
any segment.  Given the lack of a `gex_Segment_Destroy()` implementation, this
API is therefore only useful for a kind which has been created but never used.
